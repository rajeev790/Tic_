# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game played between two players. The game is built in Python and allows players to take turns to enter their moves on a 3x3 grid.

## Game Rules
1. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, represented by positions 1-9.
2. Player 1 uses **X**, and Player 2 uses **O**.
3. Players take turns selecting a position (1-9) on the grid to place their marker (X or O).
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If the grid is filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
